🔍 Project Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the first and most crucial step in any data analytics or data science workflow. The goal of this project is to explore, clean, and analyze the dataset to uncover meaningful insights, detect patterns, and prepare the data for further modeling or decision-making.

This repository demonstrates how EDA helps in understanding the structure of data, identifying trends, spotting anomalies, and validating assumptions using statistical techniques and visualizations.

⚙️ Key Steps in EDA

Data Collection & Importing – Loading datasets (CSV, Excel, SQL, or APIs).

Data Cleaning – Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Data Profiling – Understanding data types, distributions, and descriptive statistics.

Univariate Analysis – Analyzing single variables using histograms, bar charts, boxplots, etc.

Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis – Studying relationships between multiple features using scatter plots, heatmaps, and correlation analysis.

Feature Engineering (optional) – Creating new features for deeper insights.

Visualization – Using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for interactive analysis.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries

Python 🐍

Pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Numerical computations

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization

Plotly (optional) – Interactive dashboards

📌 Use Cases of EDA

Identifying hidden patterns in business/sales data.

Detecting fraud/anomalies in financial transactions.

Analyzing customer behavior for marketing strategies.

Preparing datasets for machine learning models.
